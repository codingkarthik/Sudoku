# Sudoku


I have made this repository to write a program in Clojure to solve an unsolved sudoku. 

## Objectives:

1. The program should be able to solve a sudoku puzzle.
2. The program should be able to report if a puzzle is not solvable.
3. Try to improve the speed of the code(Go from able to solve to solve it fast).
4. Test the code thoroughly.
